      "- **8PFQ**: 950 atoms, 194 residues, 6 chains, 1 frame, 833 bonds. Similar to 8PFK, the secondary structure analysis showed no helices or strands, with all residues either in coils or not assigned as protein residues.\n",

      "This comparison indicates that neither protein displays typical secondary structure elements according to the DSSP analysis, which could suggest an issue with the protein models or the analysis method.

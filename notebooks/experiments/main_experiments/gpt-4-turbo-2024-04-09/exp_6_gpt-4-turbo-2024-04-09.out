Current prompt: Simulate 1A3N and 7VDE (two PDB IDs matching hemoglobin) with identical parameters. Find the appropriate parameters for simulating hemoglobin from the literature. Then, plot the radius of gyration throughout both simulations.
Thought: To accomplish the task, I need to first find appropriate parameters for simulating hemoglobin from the literature. Once I have the parameters, I can set up and run the simulations for both PDB IDs (1A3N and 7VDE) using the same parameters. After the simulations are complete, I will plot the radius of gyration throughout both simulations. Since the first step is to find the simulation parameters, I will start by searching for literature that provides these parameters for hemoglobin simulations.

Thought: The previous action attempted to run a simulation using the SetUpandRunFunction tool but failed because the PDB ID was used instead of the file ID. To correct this, I need to download the PDB files for 1A3N and 7VDE using the PDBFileDownloader tool. Once I have the file IDs, I can then proceed to set up and run the simulations with the appropriate parameters.

Error adding solvent ValueError â€“ No template found for residue 1 (VAL).  The set of atoms is similar to PRO, but it is missing 7 hydrogen atoms.  For more information, see https://github.com/openmm/openmm/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#template
Residue code: VAL
Residue code not in solvent list. Adding forcefield                         not supported.
The simulation setup for 1A3N failed because the PDB file contains a residue that does not match the template in the forcefield files provided. This is a common issue when the PDB file contains nonstandard residues or missing atoms. To resolve this, I need to clean the PDB file using the CleaningToolFunction, which will standardize residues and add any missing atoms. After cleaning the PDB file, I can attempt to run the simulation again.

With both plots generated, I have completed the task of simulating both PDB IDs (1A3N and 7VDE) with identical parameters, and plotting the radius of gyration throughout both simulations. The plots are saved with their respective plot IDs.

Final Answer:
```
The simulations for hemoglobin PDB IDs 1A3N and 7VDE were successfully completed using identical parameters. The radius of gyration for each simulation was plotted, resulting in two plots:

- For 1A3N, the radius of gyration plot is saved as FIG_rgy_rec0_101407_20240903_110028.png with plot ID fig0_110028.
- For 7VDE, the radius of gyration plot is saved as FIG_rgy_rec0_102948_20240903_110034.png with plot ID fig0_110034.

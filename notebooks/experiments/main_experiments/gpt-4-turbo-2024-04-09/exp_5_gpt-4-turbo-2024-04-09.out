Contents of the file as a list:
Simulate PDB ID 1MBN at two different temperatures: 300 K and 400 K for 1 ns each. Plot the RMSD of both over time and compare the final secondary structures at the end of the simulations. Get information about this protein, such as the number of residues and chains, etc.
Download the PDB file for protein 1LYZ.
Download the PDB file for protein 1GZX. Then, analyze the secondary structure of the protein and provide information on how many helices, sheets, and other components are present.
What are the common parameters used to simulate fibronectin?
Simulate 1XQ8 for 1 ns at a temperature of 300 K. Then, tell me if the secondary structure changed from the beginning of the simulation to the end of the simulation.
Simulate 1A3N and 7VDE (two PDB IDs matching hemoglobin) with identical parameters. Find the appropriate parameters for simulating hemoglobin from the literature. Then, plot the radius of gyration throughout both simulations.
Simulate 1ZNI for 1 ns at a temperature of 300 K.
Simulate 4RMB at 100K, 200K, and 300K. Then, for each simulation, plot the radius of gyration over time and compare the secondary structure before and after the simulation.
Download the PDB file for 1AEE. Then tell me how many chains and atoms are present in the protein.
Simulate protein 1ZNI at 300 K for 1 ns and calculate the RMSD.
Download the PDB files for 8PFK and 8PFQ. Then, compare the secondary structures of the two proteins, including the number of atoms, secondary structures, number of chains, etc.
Simulate fibronectin (PDB ID 1FNF) for 1 ns, using an appropriate temperature from the literature.
Compare the RMSF of 1UBQ under high pressure and low pressure. Perform the simulation for 1 ns, varying only the pressure. Plot the moments of inertia over time for both simulations.
Simulate oxygenated hemoglobin (1A3N) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (6BB5).
Simulate trypsin (1TRN) for 1 ns at 300 K and compute SASA.
Download the PDB file for 1C3W and describe the secondary structure. Then, simulate the protein at 300 K for 1 ns. Plot the RMSD over time and the radius of gyration over time.
Download the PDB file for 1XQ8, and then save the visualization for it.
Download the PDB for 2YXF. Tell me about its stability as found in the literature. Then, simulate it for 1 ns and plot its RMSD over time.
Simulate 1MBN in water and methanol solutions.
Download protein 1ATN.
Download and clean protein 1A3N.
Perform a brief simulation of protein 1PQ2.
Analyze the RDF of the simulation of 1A3N solvated in water.
Simulate oxygenated hemoglobin (1A3N) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (6BB5). Then analyze the RDF of both.

Current prompt: Simulate 1XQ8 for 1 ns at a temperature of 300 K. Then, tell me if the secondary structure changed from the beginning of the simulation to the end of the simulation.
Thought: To simulate the protein with PDB ID 1XQ8 for 1 ns at 300 K and analyze the secondary structure changes, I will need to set up and run a molecular dynamics simulation using the SetUpandRunFunction tool. After the simulation is complete, I will use the ComputeDSSP tool to analyze the secondary structure at the beginning and end of the simulation.

Current prompt: Simulate oxygenated hemoglobin (1A3N) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (6BB5). Then analyze the RDF of both.
Thought: To simulate oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin and analyze the RDF (Radial Distribution Function), I need to first set up and run simulations for both forms of hemoglobin. I will start with the oxygenated hemoglobin (PDB ID: 1A3N) and then proceed with the deoxygenated hemoglobin (PDB ID: 6BB5). After the simulations, I will use the RDF tool to analyze the results.

```Setting default ewaldErrorTolerance: 0.0005
error found: constraintTolerance must be specified if rigidWater is True
 Correct this and try again.
 Everthing else is fine
Thought: The previous attempt to simulate oxygenated hemoglobin failed because the constraintTolerance parameter was not specified, which is required when rigidWater is set to True. I need to correct this by adding the constraintTolerance parameter to the system_params and then rerun the simulation for the oxygenated hemoglobin (PDB ID: 1A3N). After that, I will need to perform the same steps for the deoxygenated hemoglobin (PDB ID: 6BB5).

The previous attempt to simulate oxygenated hemoglobin failed because the input for the PDB ID was incorrect; it requires the file ID from the registry, not the PDB code. I need to download the PDB file for oxygenated hemoglobin (1A3N) using the PDBFileDownloader tool to get the correct file ID and then proceed with the simulation using the SetUpandRunFunction tool.

Action:
```
{
    "action": "PDBFileDownloader",
    "action_input": {
        "query": "1A3N"
    }
}
```PDB file found with this ID: 1A3N
Now that I have the file ID for the oxygenated hemoglobin (1A3N), I can proceed with the simulation using the SetUpandRunFunction tool. I will use the file ID obtained to set up and run the simulation with the correct parameters, including the constraintTolerance which was missing in the previous attempt.

Error adding solvent ValueError â€“ No template found for residue 1 (VAL).  The set of atoms is similar to PRO, but it is missing 7 hydrogen atoms.  For more information, see https://github.com/openmm/openmm/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#template
Residue code: VAL
Residue code not in solvent list. Adding forcefield                         not supported.
The simulation setup for oxygenated hemoglobin (1A3N) failed because the PDB file is missing hydrogen atoms for residue 1 (VAL), which is similar to PRO. To resolve this, I need to use the CleaningToolFunction to clean the PDB file by adding the missing hydrogen atoms. After cleaning the PDB file, I can attempt to rerun the simulation with the corrected file.

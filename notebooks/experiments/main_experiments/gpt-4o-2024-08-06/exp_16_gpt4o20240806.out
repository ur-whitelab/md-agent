Current prompt: Download the PDB file for 1C3W and describe the secondary structure. Then, simulate the protein at 300 K for 1 ns. Plot the RMSD over time and the radius of gyration over time.
Thought: To address the question, I need to perform the following steps:

1. Download the PDB file for 1C3W.
2. Describe the secondary structure of the protein using DSSP analysis.
3. Set up and run a molecular dynamics simulation of the protein at 300 K for 1 ns.
4. Plot the RMSD over time.
5. Plot the radius of gyration over time.

I will start by downloading the PDB file for 1C3W.

```json
{
  "action": "PDBFileDownloader",
  "action_input": {
    "query": "1C3W"
  }

To proceed, I need to analyze the secondary structure of the protein using DSSP analysis on the downloaded PDB file.

  "action": "ComputeDSSP",
  "action_input": {
    "traj_file": "1C3W_111025",

```To continue, I need to set up and run a molecular dynamics simulation of the protein at 300 K for 1 ns. After that, I will plot the RMSD and radius of gyration over time.

Error adding solvent ValueError â€“ No template found for residue 1 (THR).  The set of atoms is similar to ASP, but it is missing 5 atoms.  For more information, see https://github.com/openmm/openmm/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#template

To resolve the issue with the missing atoms in the residue, I need to clean the PDB file by adding missing atoms and hydrogens, and replacing nonstandard residues if necessary. After cleaning, I will attempt to set up and run the simulation again.

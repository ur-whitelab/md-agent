Current prompt: Simulate 1MBN in water and methanol solutions.
Thought: To simulate the protein 1MBN in water and methanol solutions, I need to first download the PDB file for 1MBN. Then, I will set up the simulation environment with water and methanol. I will use the PDBFileDownloader tool to get the PDB file for 1MBN.

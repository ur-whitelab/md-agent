Current prompt: Simulate trypsin (1TRN) for 1 ns at 300 K and compute SASA.
Thought: To simulate trypsin for 1 ns at 300 K and compute the SASA, I will need to first obtain the trypsin structure, set up the simulation environment, run the simulation, and then compute the SASA. I will start by downloading the trypsin structure using its PDB ID (1TRN).

Action:
```
{
    "action": "PDBFileDownloader",
    "action_input": {
        "query": "1TRN"
    }
}
```PDB file found with this ID: 1TRN
Thought: Now that I have the PDB file for trypsin, I need to set up and run a molecular dynamics simulation for 1 nanosecond (1 ns) at 300 K. After the simulation, I will compute the Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA).

}
```Setting default ewaldErrorTolerance: 0.0005
error found: constraintTolerance must be specified if rigidWater is True
 Correct this and try again.
 Everthing else is fine
Thought: The previous attempt to set up and run the simulation failed because the constraintTolerance parameter was not specified, which is required when rigidWater is set to True. I will correct this by adding the constraintTolerance parameter and attempt to run the simulation again.

Error adding solvent ValueError â€“ No template found for residue 1 (ILE).  The set of atoms is similar to HID, but it is missing 9 atoms.  For more information, see https://github.com/openmm/openmm/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#template
Residue code: ILE
Residue code not in solvent list. Adding forcefield                         not supported.
Thought: The simulation setup failed because the PDB file for trypsin contains a residue that does not match the template in the forcefield files provided. This is a common issue when the PDB file contains non-standard residues or missing atoms. To resolve this, I will use the CleaningToolFunction to clean the PDB file by adding missing atoms, removing heterogens, and replacing nonstandard residues with standard ones. After cleaning the PDB file, I will attempt to set up and run the simulation again.

```

Now that the PDB file for trypsin has been cleaned, I will attempt to set up and run the molecular dynamics simulation again using the cleaned PDB file. This time, the simulation should proceed without the previous errors related to non-standard residues or missing atoms.

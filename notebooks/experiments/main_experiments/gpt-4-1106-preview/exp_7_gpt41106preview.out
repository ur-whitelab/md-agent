Current prompt: Simulate 1ZNI for 1 ns at a temperature of 300 K.
Thought: To simulate the protein with PDB ID 1ZNI for 1 nanosecond at 300 K, I will need to set up and run a molecular dynamics simulation. I will use the SetUpandRunFunction tool to perform this task. Since the simulation time is not specified in terms of timesteps, I will calculate the number of steps required for a 1 ns simulation based on a typical timestep for molecular dynamics simulations, which is often around 2 fs (0.002 ps). Therefore, 1 ns would be 500,000 steps (1 ns / 0.002 ps per step). I will also need to specify the temperature as 300 K in the integrator parameters.

Thought: The previous action failed because the PDB ID was used directly instead of the file ID from the registry. I need to download the PDB file for 1ZNI using the PDBFileDownloader tool and then use the file ID obtained to set up and run the simulation.

Action:
```
{
    "action": "PDBFileDownloader",
    "action_input": {
        "query": "1ZNI"
    }
}
```PDB file found with this ID: 1ZNI
Now that I have the PDB file ID for 1ZNI, I can proceed to set up and run the molecular dynamics simulation using the SetUpandRunFunction tool. I will use the same parameters as before, but this time I will replace the "pdb_id" with the file ID "1ZNI_112617".

Error adding solvent ValueError â€“ No template found for residue 1 (GLY).  The set of atoms is similar to GLY, but it is missing 3 hydrogen atoms.  For more information, see https://github.com/openmm/openmm/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#template
Residue code: GLY
Residue code not in solvent list. Adding forcefield                         not supported.
The simulation setup failed because the PDB file is missing hydrogen atoms for residue 1 (GLY). Before attempting to run the simulation again, I need to use the CleaningToolFunction to add the missing hydrogen atoms to the PDB file. I will ensure that the tool adds hydrogens, and I will use the file ID "1ZNI_112617" for the PDB file that was downloaded.

Now that the PDB file has been cleaned and the missing hydrogen atoms have been added, I can proceed to set up and run the molecular dynamics simulation using the SetUpandRunFunction tool. I will use the cleaned file ID "1ZNI_112647" and the same simulation parameters as before to perform the simulation.

The simulation failed due to a NaN error in particle coordinates, which suggests an issue with the system setup, possibly related to the nonbonded interactions or constraints. To address this, I will attempt to run the simulation with a different nonbonded method and without constraints to see if this resolves the issue. I will also disable solvation to simplify the system, which may help identify the source of the problem.

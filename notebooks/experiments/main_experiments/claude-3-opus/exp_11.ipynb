      "1. The SummarizeProteinStructure tool showed that 8PFK has 487 atoms, 109 residues, 2 chains, 1 frame and 420 bonds. 8PFQ has 950 atoms, 194 residues, 6 chains, 1 frame and 833 bonds. \n",

This means the DSSP algorithm did not identify any of the residues as being part of an α-helix, β-strand or coil, which are the typical secondary structure elements of proteins.\n",

I would recommend double checking the PDB IDs and downloading the files again, or trying alternative PDB entries for the proteins of interest to troubleshoot the issue.\n",
